üîê AI-Powered Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
This project implements an AI-powered Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that leverages machine learning to classify network traffic as either normal or malicious in real time. It is built using the UNSW-NB15 dataset, which contains labeled traffic data representing modern attack scenarios. The model is trained on selected features to optimize real-time performance and accuracy.

üß† Key Features
Machine Learning Model: Uses a Random Forest Classifier trained on key traffic features (proto, pkt_len, src_port, dst_port, flags) to detect intrusions.

Real-Time Integration Ready: Designed to work seamlessly with a GUI-based system or a real-time packet capture module.

Feature Engineering: Includes simulated real-time features such as pkt_len (packet length) and dummy values for ports and flags.

Label Encoding: Protocols (TCP, UDP, etc.) are encoded numerically for compatibility with ML models.

Model Persistence: The trained model is saved as a .pkl file (ids_model.pkl) for fast loading and prediction.

Extendable: Can be integrated into a broader network security system with live packet sniffing and threat visualization.

üóÇ Dataset
Source: UNSW-NB15

Description: Modern network intrusion dataset with various attack categories like Fuzzers, Analysis, DoS, Backdoors, Shellcode, Reconnaissance, etc.

‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack
Python

scikit-learn

pandas

joblib

LabelEncoder & StandardScaler

Optional: GUI and real-time packet capture via scapy or socket

üöÄ How It Works
Preprocess and encode the dataset features.

Train a Random Forest model on selected features.

Save the trained model (ids_model.pkl).

In a GUI or real-time application, capture live packet data, extract features, transform them, and use the model to predict if it's an attack or not.
